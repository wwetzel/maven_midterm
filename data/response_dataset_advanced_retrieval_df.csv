Fair value\nof the marke table securi ties is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments  are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured\nat fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For\nderivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting\nlosses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\ngains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when\nthe hedged exposure is recognized in earning s. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in\nearnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist prima rily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts\nreceivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and\nincludes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’  financial condition and maintain an allowance for\npotential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall', 'Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may conta in more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer\ncontract is distinct. Exce pt for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA  products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a\nsignificant amount of integration or interdepende ncy. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct\nand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple perfor mance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling\nprice basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable\ncircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately , we\ndetermine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property , plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\nestimated useful life of a majority of the server , storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test\nequipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of\nrevenue and operating expenses, respectively , which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or\n$0.05 per both basic and diluted share.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below .

"""How have recent USG export restrictions impacted NVIDIA's A100 and H100 chips, and what could result from limits on exports to China and Russia?""","
Assistant: The recent USG export restrictions have significantly impacted NVIDIA's A100 and H100 chips, as these restrictions apply to exports of certain chips, software, hardware, equipment, and technology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia. Specifically, these restrictions impact DGX or any other systems or boards that incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. Additionally, licensing requirements apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits.

If NVIDIA is unable to receive licenses to ship these restricted products to China, it may negatively impact their business and financial results. Furthermore, any new control that impacts a wider range of NVIDIA's products would likely have a disproportionate impact on the company and may disadvantage them against certain competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.

Excessive or shifting export controls may encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to ""design-out"" certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, which could negatively impact NVIDIA's business, market position, and financial results. Additionally, overseas governments may request that NVIDIA's customers purchase from their competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, further harming their business.","['products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls.

Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.\nAdditional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and\ndevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve\noverseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our\nproducts and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our\nsales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators\nconclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions\non our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the third quarter  of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and expo rt licensing requirements targeting China’ s semiconductor and\nsupercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,\nproduce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,\nDGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.

For example, the USG\nhas already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license\nconditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking  and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if\ncertain syste m or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such\ncontrols to restrict addit ional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supp ly and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such\nproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our\nproducts, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact\ndemand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-\nspeed netwo rk interconn ects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider\nrange of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvant age us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are\noutside the scope of such control.

Assistant: Marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, have readily determinable fair values and are recorded as long-term other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in Other income and expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended January 28, 2024, marketable equity securities totaled $225 million. There were no significant net unrealized or realized gains for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies, do not have readily determinable fair values. They are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

For the year ended January 28, 2024, the adjustments to non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative were as follows: the carrying amount as of January 29, 2023 was $288 million, there were net additions of $859 million, unrealized gains of $194 million, and impairments and unrealized losses of $(20) million. The carrying amount as of January 28, 2024 was $1,321 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, one of the private company investments completed a secondary equity raise that resulted in an unrealized gain of $178 million.

"""How does NVIDIA determine fair value of financial instruments in its statements?""","
Assistant: NVIDIA determines the fair value of financial instruments in its statements using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. For marketable securities, the fair value is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value, with the accounting for changes in fair value depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings.
