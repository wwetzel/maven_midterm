reduction in unrecognize d tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of federal benefit, partially offset by additional cash tax
payments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.

Concentration of Revenue
Revenue by geographic  region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises and
gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 56% and 69% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024
and 2023, respectively .
Our direct and indirect customers include public cloud, consumer internet companies, enter prises, startups, public sector entities, OEMs, ODMs, system
integrators, AIB, and distributors.
Sales to one customer , Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
One indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have
represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
Our estimated Compute & Networking demand is expected to remain concentrated.
There were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer
fabrication, assembly , testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such
purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes
acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel
associated with manufacturing operations.
Our overall gross margin  increased to 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.9% in fiscal year 2023 . The year over year increase was primarily due to strong Data
Center revenue growth of 217% and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue.","{40, 78, 39}","

Our support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility , to take care of our existing team of world-class talent and their families.
Diversity , Inclusion, and Belonging
We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees.
When recruiting for new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes those underrepresented in the
technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.
To this end, we have been:
•Partnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;
•Embedding dedicated recruiting teams to busin ess areas to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and find internal
opportunities;
•Supporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders;
•Providing peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;
•Providing training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for diversity;
•Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay , and employee engagement scores; and
•Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity ef forts.
As of the end of fiscal year 2024, our global workforce was 79% male, 20% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our workforce in the United States
composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.
Flexible W orking Environment
We support a flexible work environment, understanding that many employees want the ability to work from home under certain conditions. This flexibility
supports diverse hiring, retention, and employee engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA  a great place to work.

existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur
in phases. W e will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially af fect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our manage ment, includ ing our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , within NVIDIA  have been detected.
Item 9B.  Other Information
On December 18, 2023, John O. Dabiri, a member of our Board of Directors, adopted a trading arrangement that is intended to satisfy the af firmative defense
conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale through December 2, 2024 of an estimated 553 shares of our common stock, assuming our closing stock price as of

Our support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility , to take care of our existing team of world-class talent and their families.
Diversity , Inclusion, and Belonging
We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees.
When recruiting for new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes those underrepresented in the
technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.
To this end, we have been:
•Partnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;
•Embedding dedicated recruiting teams to busin ess areas to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and find internal
opportunities;
•Supporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders;
•Providing peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;
•Providing training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for diversity;
•Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay , and employee engagement scores; and
•Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity ef forts.
As of the end of fiscal year 2024, our global workforce was 79% male, 20% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our workforce in the United States
composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.
Flexible W orking Environment
We support a flexible work environment, understanding that many employees want the ability to work from home under certain conditions. This flexibility
supports diverse hiring, retention, and employee engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA  a great place to work.

in phases. W e will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially af fect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our manage ment, includ ing our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , within NVIDIA  have been detected.
Item 9B.  Other Information
On December 18, 2023, John O. Dabiri, a member of our Board of Directors, adopted a trading arrangement that is intended to satisfy the af firmative defense
conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale through December 2, 2024 of an estimated 553 shares of our common stock, assuming our closing stock price as of

What specific cybersecurity event is mentioned as becoming increasingly prevalent and severe?,"Ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors are mentioned as becoming increasingly prevalent and severe.","Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent
and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is
delayed or not feasible.
Individuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors have engaged
and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally , some actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated
attacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to a heightened
risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. We may also face cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional
misconduct by employees, contractors or other  third-party service providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees,
contractors and/or other third-party service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control
mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incide nts arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information
or adhere to our security  policies and access control mechanisms and, although no such events  have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can
be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in an incident that is material to us. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party
suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology ,
employee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and
infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’  supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or
bugs that could result in a breach of or disrupt ion to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information
We have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and reactively address circumstances that arise when
unexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur . These include processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity
threats. Our information security management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 international standard for
Information Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk
management and governance experts, on risk management and strategy .
Identifying, assessing, and managing cybersec urity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes, and we have in place
cybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new requirements in global privacy laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to,
mitigate and recover from identified and significant cybersecurity threats.
We also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate cybersecurity
risks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access to confidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designed
to ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors. We
routinely assess our high-risk suppliers’  conform ance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TP AT), and we evaluate them for additional
information, product, and physical security requirements.
Refer to “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information about cybersecurity-related risks.
Governance
Information security matters, including managin g and assessing risks from cybersecurity threats, remain under the oversight of the Company’ s Board of
Directors, or the Board. The Audit Committee of the Board, or the Audit Committee, also reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’ s information
security policies and practices and the internal controls regarding information security risks. The Audit Committee receives regular information security updates

information related to the security incident. Additionally , we are incorporated into the supply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our
products or services are compromised, a signific ant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm
our business.
To defend against secur ity incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to
result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed
to ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, applicable
industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security awareness initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate
certain vulne rabilities that we have identified, we may not always be able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls,
systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a
security incident has occurred. Further , we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address identified vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident.
We hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. Breaches of our security measures,
along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary inform ation or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties,
could expos e us and the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability , regulatory

requirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 . The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of
risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. These include domestic and intern ational economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do
business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment
practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations,
natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events.
Product, system security , and data protecti on breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue,
increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.
Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures,

Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more
comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protecti ons, more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These
competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and
end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a
supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar
to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete

Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing
•Failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
•Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over product
quantity and quality , manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business.

or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’  orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relatio nships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market
share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability
issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.
If we overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may
not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including
due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may
need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’  increase in prices, and we may need to
continue to do so for other products in the future . We have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may
have to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our
historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may
continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total

product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain
complexity . Additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available
from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply
or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead
times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and
may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity ,
which may require additional deposits. W e may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
Many additio nal factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products,
or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:
•changes in product development cycles and time to market;
•competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;

NVIDIA  invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate sound environmental, social, and corporate
governance principles and practices into every aspect of the Company . The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is
outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other
impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to
serve marke ts worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that
our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result,
excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and service s not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe,
Latin Americ a, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the
time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase
investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.
Additionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and increased oversight of digital platfo rm companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions
on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese
government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain produ cts made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on
our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
Finally , our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that
negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.
Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regula tors and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG
has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license
conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking  and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if
certain syste m or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such
controls to restrict addit ional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supp ly and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such
products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our
products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact
demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-
speed netwo rk interconn ects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider

impact our manufacturin g, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and
could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,
which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restric t our ability to export our technology , products, or services even
though comp etitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial
results. Expo rt controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products
to additional  restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacti ng our business and financial results. Controls could negatively
impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA  AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and
customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.
Export contr ols could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China

products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting

requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG
has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license
conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking  and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if
certain syste m or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such
controls to restrict addit ional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supp ly and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such
products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our
products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact
demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-
speed netwo rk interconn ects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider
range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvant age us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are
outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other
impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to
serve marke ts worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that
our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result,

products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively
impact our manufacturin g, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and
could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,
which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restric t our ability to export our technology , products, or services even
though comp etitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial
results. Expo rt controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products
to additional  restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacti ng our business and financial results. Controls could negatively
impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA  AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and
customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.
Export contr ols could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financ ial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.","{9, 26, 25}"

NVIDIA  Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our Company
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA  was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA  Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year , ending on the last Sunday in January . Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-week years.
Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA  Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of finan cial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expense s during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimat es. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to revenue  recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income
taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restru cturing and other charges, property , plant, and equipment, and
other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property , plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the
estimated useful life of most of our server , storage, and network equipment from three  to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to
seven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating
expenses, respectively , which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and
diluted share.

Business Strategies
NVIDIA ’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:
Advancing the NVIDIA  accelerated computing platform.  Our accelerated computing platform can solve complex problems in significantly less time and with
lower power  consumption than alternative comp utational approaches. Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to
deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore’ s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, interconnect, and software
layers. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets,
which includ e Data Center , Gaming, Professio nal Visualization, and Automotive. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we
address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs, CUDA  and netw orking technologies as the fundamental building blocks. The
programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in research and development: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end

or generate enough renewable energy to match  100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers. In fiscal year 2023, we increased the
percentage of our total electricity use matched by renewable energy purchases to 44%. By fiscal year 2026, we aim to engage manufacturing suppliers
comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA ’s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions with goal of ef fecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.
Whether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is
important in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-accelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for
many worklo ads because it is optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is evidenced by
our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-ef ficient systems. We powered 24 of the top 30 most energy efficient systems, including
the top supercomputer , on the Green500 list.
We plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA  AI and NVIDIA  Omniverse platform s. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies, and policy makers
to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.
Human Capital Management
We believe that our employees are our greates t assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year
2024, we had approximately 29,600 employees in 36 countries, 22,200 were engaged in research and development and 7,400 were engaged in sales,
marketing, operations, and administrative positions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies
relating to human capital management.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully , we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives,
scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staf f.

NVIDIA  Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our Company
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA  was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA  Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year , ending on the last Sunday in January . Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-week years.
Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA  Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of finan cial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expense s during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimat es. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to revenue  recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income
taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restru cturing and other charges, property , plant, and equipment, and
other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property , plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the
estimated useful life of most of our server , storage, and network equipment from three  to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to
seven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating
expenses, respectively , which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and
diluted share.
