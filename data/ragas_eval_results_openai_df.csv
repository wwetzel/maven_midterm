Under the 'Assets' section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, there are cash equivalents and marketable securities, property and equipment, operating lease assets, goodwill, intangible assets, deferred income tax assets, and other assets. 

The cash equivalents and marketable securities are further classified into:
- Money market funds (Level 1), which were valued at $3,031 million as of January 28, 2024.
- Corporate debt securities (Level 2), which were valued at $10,152 million as of January 28, 2024.
- Debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury (Level 2), which were valued at $9,524 million as of January 28, 2024.
- Debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies (Level 2), which were valued at $2,333 million as of January 28, 2024.
- Certificates of deposit (Level 2), which were valued at $510 million as of January 28, 2024.
- Foreign government bonds (Level 2), which were valued at $174 million as of January 28, 2024.
- Publicly-held equity securities (Level 1), which were valued at $225 million as of January 28, 2024.

The property and equipment, operating lease assets, goodwill, intangible assets, and deferred income tax assets are not classified by pricing category in the provided document. 

The other assets include investments in non-affiliated entities, which are further classified into:
- Marketable equity securities (Level 1), which were valued at $225 million as of January 28, 2024.
- Non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies.

"""How have recent USG export restrictions impacted NVIDIA's A100 and H100 chips, and what could result from limits on exports to China and Russia?""","
Answer:

Recent USG export restrictions have significantly impacted NVIDIA's A100 and H100 chips, as well as systems or boards that incorporate these integrated circuits. These restrictions apply not only to direct exports to China and Russia, but also to any future NVIDIA integrated circuits that achieve certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds. Additionally, there are now licensing requirements for a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China.

In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel. These requirements became effective in NVIDIA's fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports of products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S, and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.

As a result of these restrictions, NVIDIA has transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time-consuming, potentially adversely affecting NVIDIA's research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as its revenue, during any such transition period.

Furthermore, these restrictions could lead to reduced demand for NVIDIA's products or services, negatively impacting its business and financial results. Excess inventory or supply charges could also result from reduced demand. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls could negatively impact the ability of NVIDIA's research and development teams to execute their roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact NVIDIA's ability to serve overseas markets but could also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, negatively impacting its supply chain or its ability to provide products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could substantially reduce its revenue.

Regulators in China have inquired about NVIDIA's sales and efforts to supply the China market and its fulfillment of commitments entered at the close of its Mellanox acquisition. If regulators conclude that NVIDIA has failed to fulfill such commitments or has violated any applicable law in China, it could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on its ability to conduct business, which could have a material and adverse impact on its business, operating results, and financial condition.","['supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,\nproduce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,\nDGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated\ncircuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are\nalso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in\nChina. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to\nthe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,\nincluding China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,\nH800, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and\nHong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution\noperations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,'
 'products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to\nimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting\nour business and financ ial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.\nAdditional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and\ndevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve\noverseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our\nproducts and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our\nsales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators\nconclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions\non our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the third quarter  of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and expo rt licensing requirements targeting China’ s semiconductor and\nsupercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,\nproduce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,\nDGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated\ncircuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are'
 'event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG\nhas already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license\nconditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking  and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if\ncertain syste m or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such\ncontrols to restrict addit ional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supp ly and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such\nproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our\nproducts, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact\ndemand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-\nspeed netwo rk interconn ects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider\nrange of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvant age us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are\noutside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other\nimpacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to\nserve marke ts worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that\nour customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results.

This could potentially lead to NVIDIA being excluded from the China market and other impacted markets, including the Middle East. Additionally, limits on exports to China and Russia could result in NVIDIA facing compliance burdens, reduced demand for their products, excess inventory, supply charges, and disruptions to their supply and distribution chain. Furthermore, it may harm NVIDIA's competitive position, as customers may seek alternatives from competitors less likely to be restricted by export controls.","['supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,\nproduce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,\nDGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated\ncircuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are\nalso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in\nChina. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to\nthe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,\nincluding China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,\nH800, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and\nHong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution\noperations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,'
 'products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to\nimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting\nour business and financ ial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.\nAdditional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and\ndevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve\noverseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our\nproducts and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our\nsales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition.

Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact\ndemand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-\nspeed netwo rk interconn ects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training.

"""How are marketable equity securities valued and recorded on the Balance Sheets, and what adjustments were made to non-marketable equity securities?""","
Answer:
Marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, have readily determinable fair values and are recorded as long-term other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in Other income and expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of January 28, 2024, marketable equity securities totaled $225 million. There were no significant net unrealized and realized gains or losses for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022.

On the other hand, non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies, do not have readily determinable fair values. They are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

For the year ended January 28, 2024, adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative were as follows: the carrying amount as of January 29, 2023 was $288 million; there were net additions of $859 million, unrealized gains of $194 million, and impairments and unrealized losses of ($20) million. The carrying amount as of January 28, 2024 was $1,321 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, one of the private company investments completed a secondary equity raise that resulted in an unrealized gain of $178 million. Net unrealized gains recognized for the year ended January 28, 2024 for non-marketable investments in non-affiliated entities still held as of January 28, 2024 were $174 million.","['primarily investments in privately held companie s.

"""How does NVIDIA determine fair value of financial instruments in its statements?""","
Answer:
 NVIDIA determines the fair value of financial instruments in its statements using quoted market prices. For marketable securities, which are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, the fair value is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities.","['Table of Contents\nNVIDIA  Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nNote 9 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Investments in Non-Affiliated Entities\nThe fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from\nactive markets.
