Today , it also simulates human intelligence,\nenabling a deeper understanding of the physica l world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deep\nlearning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amoun ts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-\ndriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and\nproducts that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional coding. Examples include generative AI, which can create new content\nsuch as text, code, images, audio, video, and molecule structures, and recommendation systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as\nproducts, services, media or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user preferences.\nNVIDIA  has a platform strategy , bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we', 'the end of fiscal year 2024.

Today , it also simulates human intelligence,\nenabling a deeper understanding of the physica l world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deep\nlearning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from large amoun ts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-\ndriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and\nproducts that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional coding. Examples include generative AI, which can create new content\nsuch as text, code, images, audio, video, and molecule structures, and recommendation systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as\nproducts, services, media or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user preferences.\nNVIDIA  has a platform strategy , bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to create unique value for the markets we', 'Table of Contents\nNVIDIA  Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In completing\nour impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. \nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors af fecting the reporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market\nvaluation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and\ncomparable multiples from publicly traded comp anies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic\nfactors and the future profitability of our business. \nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under\ntechnology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a\nmethod that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are cons umed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably\ndetermined, using a straight-line amortization method.\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortizatio n, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount  of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.

Assistant: The financial statements provided include the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity, Consolidated Statements of Income, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net income per share is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For diluted net income per share, the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding is used in the calculation. The potentially dilutive shares are calculated using the treasury stock method, and any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation.

In the context you provided, the net income per share calculations for the years ended January 28, 2024, January 29, 2023, and January 30, 2022 are as follows:

- Basic net income per share: Net income divided by basic weighted average shares
  - For the year ended January 28, 2024: $29,760 / 2,469 = $12.05
  - For the year ended January 29, 2023: $4,368 / 2,487 = $1.76
  - For the year ended January 30, 2022: $9,752 / 2,496 = $3.91

- Diluted net income per share: Net income divided by diluted weighted average shares
  - For the year ended January 28, 2024: $29,760 / 2,494 = $11.93
  - For the year ended January 29, 2023: $4,368 / 2,507 = $1.74

The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and already have disadvantaged and may in the future\n26', 'obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing\nprovisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and\nmarket conditions. This in turn led to significant  auditor judgment, subjectivity , and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’ s assumptions\nrelated to future demand and market conditions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing proce dures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’ s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess\nproduct purchase commitments, including controls over management’ s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, testing management’ s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\ncommitments; evaluating  the appropriateness of management’ s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and\nevaluating the reasonableness of management’ s assumptions related to future demand and mark et conditions. Evaluating management’ s assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past\nresults, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology .\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 21, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’ s auditor since 2004.\n49', 'Table of Contents\nPart I\nItem 1.
