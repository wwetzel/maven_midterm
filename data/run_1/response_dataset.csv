These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property , plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\nestimated useful life of most of our server , storage, and network equipment from three  to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to\nseven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating\nexpenses, respectively , which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and\ndiluted share.\nRevenue Recognition', 'Table of Contents\napproximately 7 million shares for a total value of $2.8 billion through net share settlements.

"""What industries benefit from NVIDIA computing solutions and what products do they offer?""","
Answer:
 Based on the provided context, NVIDIA computing solutions benefit several industries, including Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. In the Data Center industry, NVIDIA offers supercomputing platforms and servers that deliver significantly better performance and power efficiency for compute-intensive workloads like AI, data analytics, graphics, and scientific computing. They also provide networking offerings that consist of end-to-end platforms for InfiniBand and Ethernet, along with a full software stack.

 In the Gaming industry, NVIDIA offers GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics. They also provide virtual GPU, or vGPU, software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing.

 For Professional Visualization, NVIDIA provides solutions for a range of creative and design use cases, such as creating visual effects in movies or designing buildings and products. They also offer Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating metaverse and 3D internet applications.

 Lastly, in the Automotive industry, NVIDIA offers solutions for infotainment systems and automotive platforms. They also have a unified AI computing architecture for self-driving vehicles, which starts with training deep neural networks using their Data Center computing solutions and then runs a full perception, fusion, planning, and control stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform.","['Table of Contents\nResearchers and developers use our computing  solutions to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to climate\nforecasting.

"""What financial units are in the statements and how is net income per share calculated?""","
Answer:
Based on the provided context, the financial units mentioned are Common Stock, Outstanding, Additional Paid-in, Treasury, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, Retained Earnings, and Total Shareholders' Equity. 

The net income per share is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period for basic net income per share. For diluted net income per share, it is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.","['of the tax position.

"""What role do solution architects play in optimizing hardware and software for AI training and deployment, and how does it improve network efficiency and customer satisfaction?""","
Answer:
Based on the provided context, solution architects play a crucial role in optimizing hardware and software for AI training and deployment. They work with Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to provide pre-sales assistance in optimizing their hardware and software infrastructure for generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) training and deployment. They also work with foundation model and enterprise software developers to optimize the training and fine-tuning of their models and services. Furthermore, they assist enterprise end-users, often in collaboration with their global system integrator of choice, to fine-tune models and build AI applications.

This depth and quality of design support is key to improving the partner network's time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage end customers and partner network to use the next generation of their products within each platform. By optimizing the hardware and software infrastructure for AI training and deployment, solution architects can help improve network efficiency and customer satisfaction.

"""What are the restrictions on Covered Officers regarding indemnification and expenses under the Compensation Recovery Policy, and how does it impact the Company's legal options?""","
Answer:
Based on the provided context, Covered Officers are not entitled to indemnification against the loss of Recoverable Incentive Compensation under the Compensation Recovery Policy. This means that if the Company needs to recover incentive compensation due to an Accounting Restatement, the Covered Officer cannot be reimbursed or indemnified for this loss. Additionally, Covered Officers are not entitled to advancement of expenses in connection with any enforcement of this Policy by the Company, including payment or reimbursement for the Covered Officer’s insurance premiums to cover potential obligations to the Company under this Policy. These restrictions do not limit any claims, damages, or other legal remedies the Company may have against a Covered Officer, and the Company can still take other actions to enforce a Covered Officer’s obligations to the Company, such as termination of employment and/or institution of civil proceedings. The Policy also states that any action by the Company to recover or any recovery of Recoverable Incentive Compensation under this Policy from a Covered Officer shall not be deemed 'good reason' for resignation or to serve as a basis for a claim of constructive termination under any benefits or compensation arrangements applicable to such Covered Officer, or to constitute a breach of any contract or other arrangement to which such Covered Officer is a party. Therefore, the Company's legal options are not impacted negatively by these restrictions.","['COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY\nlaw or contract.
