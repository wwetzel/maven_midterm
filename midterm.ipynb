For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the MultiQueryRetriever might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results.\n",
