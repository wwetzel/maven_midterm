    "A vector store retriever is a retriever that uses a vector store to retrieve documents. It is a lightweight wrapper around the vector store class to make it conform to the retriever interface. It uses the search methods implemented by a vector store, like similarity search and MMR, to query the texts in the vector store.\n",

    "This seems like the best general option, and a major upgrade from Vector store-backed retriever\n",

    "The MultiQueryRetriever automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the MultiQueryRetriever might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results.\n",

The idea is simple: instead of immediately returning retrieved documents as-is, you can compress them using the context of the given query, so that only the relevant information is returned. ‚ÄúCompressing‚Äù here refers to both compressing the contents of an individual document and filtering out documents wholesale.\n",
